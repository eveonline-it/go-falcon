# Memory Bank Archive

## Purpose
This directory contains historical documentation moved from active memory bank files to reduce token usage while preserving important implementation history.

## Archived Files

### Historical Work
- **historical-work-2025-08.md** - Development work completed in August 2025 (archived from CLAUDE-activeContext.md)

## Usage
Reference these files when:
- Investigating similar issues or understanding implementation decisions
- Understanding the evolution of system architecture
- Looking up historical context for current development

## Archive Policy
Files are moved here when:
- Historical work is no longer current session context (>2 weeks old)
- Implementation details are resolved and documented elsewhere
- Content is valuable for reference but not needed in active context

## Maintenance
- Review active memory bank files monthly for archival candidates
- Ensure archived content is well-organized and discoverable
- Update this README when new files are archived
